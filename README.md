This repository is a stand-alone example of how to parse basketball player tracking data. From an R session, simply run `source('game_processor.R')`

If you are interested in more examples of what can be done with player tracking data, check out my thesis: 

[*An Investigation of Three-point Shooting through an Analysis of NBA Player Tracking Data*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07030)
